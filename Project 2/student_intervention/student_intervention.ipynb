    "I'm using boosted decision trees, support vector machines, and gaussian naive bayes for this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Boosted decision trees work well when we have many features, but don't know which ones help with classifying, so it works well with word recognition (e.g. spam filters) or picture recognition. But a boosted decision tree can only be as strong as the weak learners used to build it. If they misclassify due to outliers or other noise in the data, it can hurt the big decision tree. We've got almost 50 features after processing, so I don't want to take the time to  build full decision trees or risk excluding important features with shorter trees, so decision trees seem like a good idea to try. \n",
    "\n",
    "Support vector machines work well with moderately sized datasets that should have an optimal separator, so it works when we're trying to find distinct groups in our data. Since SVMs work by using kernels to project to higher dimensions, SVM can perform well even when a dataset has more features than points. And because only points close to the margin of separation affect the decision boundary, SVMs aren't sensitive to outliers, but they are sensitive to noise. We also don't want to use it in cases where we have a large dataset with many features because of memory and speed concerns, so SVMs not a good candidate for classifying images without doing some feature processing/reduction beforehand. Since we've done some feature processing on the data, and we don't have an absurd amount of features/datapoints, SVM appears to be a good classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naive bayes work well with datasets that have many features, so it's used with language (like building a spam filter) or image recognition. Naive bayes won't overfit the model because the assumption about independence between features means noise/outliers don't get weighed more than the rest of the data. But naive bayes won't pick up on any relationships between features, so it may underfit the model, i.e. naive bayes is robust to variance, but susceptible to bias. It's also fast and works well even with small datasets. It's an ok choice here because if it performs well, we have a good classifier. If it doesn't, it tells us that the features are related, which we can use to tune the other models."

The naive bayes model is slower, but the performance is much worse than the SVM. We're valuing performance the highest here, since we don't want to waste resources on a student that doesn't need help or neglect a student that's failing. Plus since naive bayes didn't perform well on either set, it tells us that SVM is best capturing the relationship between the features in the data."

    "Suppose there are some students standing in field and where they're standing is determined by parts of the data about them. We want to draw a straight line in the field, such that all the students on one side are passing and all the students on the other side are failing. When we have only two students, one that's passing and one that's not, we can draw all sorts of lines on the field that work. But if we add more students, we have to be wary of having a student be on the incorrect side. So when we first draw the line, we want to have as much space as possible from the line to the students (ones that don't share the same group) that are closest to each other. Now suppose that we can't separate the students with a straight line. However, we might be able to draw a circle or a curved line that does. And we use the data that determined their positions in the first place to find that circle/curved line. Once we have our separator, we want to see if it works for new students, so we see which side of the line they fall on to decide if they need help or not. "
